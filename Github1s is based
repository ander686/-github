Github1s is based on VS Code 1.52.1 now. VS Code can be built for a browser version officially. I also used the code and got inspired by Code Server.
Thanks to the very powerful and flexible extensibility of VS Code, we can easily implement a VS Code extension that provides the custom File IO ability using FileSystemProvider API. There is an official demo named vscode-web-playground which shows how it is used.
On the other hand, GitHub provides the powerful REST API that can be used for a variety of tasks which includes reading directories and files for sure.
According to the above, obviously, the core concept of GitHub1s is to implement a VS Code Extension (includes FileSystemProvider) using GitHub REST API.
We may switch to the GitHub GraphQL API for more friendly user experience in the future, thanks to @xcv58 and @kanhegaonkarsaurabh. See details at Issue 12.
GitHub1s is a purely static web app (because it really doesn't need a backend service, does it?). So we just deploy it on GitHub Pages now (the gh-pages branch of this repository), and it is free. The service of GitHub1s could be reliable (GitHub is very reliable) because nobody needs to pay the web hosting bills.
